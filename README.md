# Push Swap

## üìå Overview

**Push Swap** is a project designed to implement and optimize a set of algorithms that sort a stack of integers using a limited set of instructions. The main goal is to minimize the number of moves required to achieve correct sorting.

## üöÄ Features

- Sorts a stack of integers using a limited set of instructions.
- Implementaction of the [Turk Algorithm](https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97)
- Designed to work with small and medium-sized stacks (up to 500 elements).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Operative: **Linux**, **macOS** or **Windows**.
- Compiler: **GCC** or equivalent.
- Functional Makefile.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation

To compile the project, simply run the command:

make

## üîÄ Allowed Instructions

The program must operate exclusively with the following instructions:

- **`sa`**: Swaps the first two elements of stack `a`.
- **`sb`**: Swaps the first two elements of stack `b`.
- **`ss`**: Performs  `sa` and `sb` simultaneously.
- **`pa`**: Pushes the first element of stack `b` onto `a`.
- **`pb`**: Pushes the first element of stack `a` onto `b`.
- **`ra`**: Rotates stack `a` upwards.
- **`rb`**: Rotates stack `b` upwards.
- **`rr`**: Performs  `ra` and `rb` simultaneously.
- **`rra`**: Rotates stack `a` downwards.
- **`rrb`**: Rotates stack `b` downwards.
- **`rrr`**: Performs  `rra` and `rrb` simultaneously.

## Execution exmaple

Here‚Äôs a execution example and a step-by-step visualization of the sorting process:

To execute the program, use the following syntax:
```sh
./push_swap 5 3 2 1 4
```
Output:
```sh
pb
pb
sa
rra
pa
ra
ra
pa
ra
```
